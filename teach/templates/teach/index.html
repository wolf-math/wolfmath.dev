  <p>The vast majority of my lesson plans were written in LaTeX markup langugage. I am working on compiling them into
  a single work called "The Big Open Source Math Book." There's a lot of work left, but you can 
  <a href="https://github.com/wolf-math/Big-Open-Source-Math-Book">view its progress on GitHub</a></p>

  <p>I am also working on converting all of these lessons into interactive Jupyter (iPython) Notebooks which is what you see below</p>

  {% for notebook in mathnotebooks %}
    <a href="{{ notebook.notebook_url }}">
      <div class="card mb-3">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title"> {{ notebook.title }} </h5>
          <p class="card-text"> {{ notebhook.description }} </p>
          <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">updated {{ notebook.created_on }}</small></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </a>

  {% endfor %}
